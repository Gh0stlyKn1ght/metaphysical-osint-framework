# üöÄ Metaphysical OSINT Framework (MOF v1.0)

*A fusion of astral projection, energetic sensing, and open-source intelligence techniques.*

### üß† What Is Metaphysical OSINT?

**Metaphysical OSINT** is the structured gathering and analysis of symbolic, energetic, or non-physical intelligence using spiritual or altered-state techniques, interpreted through the lens of open-source intelligence methodology.

It merges:

* The data discipline of **OSINT** (open-source intelligence)
* The experiential awareness of **spiritual intelligence (SQ)**
* The navigational skill of **astral projection, lucid dreaming, and non-local cognition**

---

### üåå Why It Was Created

As a cyber-spiritual explorer, I saw a void between:

* Cold, analytical intelligence work
* And deeply intuitive, metaphysical experiences

**MOF v1.0** is my answer ‚Äî a framework that honors both the rational and the mystical, giving structure to non-physical exploration and symbolic intelligence gathering.

This framework offers:

* Classification systems for nonlocal data
* Symbol decryption and mission logging tools
* Visual systems for mission patching and recon rituals

### ‚ú® Origin of the Term

The term **Metaphysical OSINT** was coined in May 2025 during a series of philosophical discussions on the intersection of spiritual experience and cybersecurity intelligence practices.

While exploring altered states (astral projection, lucid dreaming, intuitive downloads), I noticed a pattern: the same methods used to collect and analyze digital intelligence (OSINT) could be conceptually applied to symbolic, energetic, or non-physical data. This realization led to the synthesis of both disciplines.

The name was chosen to reflect:

* **‚ÄúMetaphysical‚Äù**: referring to the non-empirical, experiential, and symbolic realms
* **‚ÄúOSINT‚Äù**: open-source intelligence, denoting structured, non-invasive data collection and analysis

This framework emerged organically through personal practice, pattern recognition, and the need to give structure to symbolic information retrieved during spiritual exploration.

It is my intention that this term ‚Äî and the framework that supports it ‚Äî be available for open application, refinement, and collaboration among interdisciplinary researchers, mystics, and cyber-philosophers alike.

## üîç OSINT vs. Metaphysical OSINT Comparison

| Category          | Traditional OSINT                     | Metaphysical OSINT                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Source Type       | Public digital data                   | Symbolic, energetic, or non-physical data      |
| Tools Used        | Recon tools, scrapers, search engines | Astral projection, meditation, lucid dreaming  |
| Analysis Style    | Logical, pattern-based                | Intuitive, symbolic, archetypal                |
| Intelligence Type | Technical, social, geopolitical       | Emotional, spiritual, archetypal               |
| Output            | Reports, threat models                | Insight logs, symbolic decryption, integration |
